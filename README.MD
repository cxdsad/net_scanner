# Async Net Scanner

A high-performance asynchronous TCP port scanner written in Rust using `tokio`, capable of scanning random public IPs with payload-based interaction. It supports custom payloads per port and logs meaningful responses either to the console or to a CSV file.

---
## ‚ú® Features

- Asynchronous, non-blocking design with tokio
- Randomized public IPv4 scanning (excluding private/reserved ranges)
- Custom payloads per port loaded from a JSON file
- CSV logging via csv_async (optional)
- Console logging toggle
- Configurable task limits and timeouts
- Graceful panic handling with stack traces
- Concurrent multi-port scanning per host
- Placeholders (%ip% and %port%)

### üìÑ `payloads.json` Format

The `payloads.json` file defines custom payloads to be sent for each port during scanning. This allows you to elicit meaningful responses from common services.

#### üßæ Example

```json
{
  "_comment": "This is a comment and will be ignored by the parser",
  "80":  "GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: %ip%:%port%\\r\\n\\r\\n",
  "21":  "USER anonymous\\r\\nPASS guest@\\r\\n",
  "443": "HEAD / HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\\r\\n"
}
```
